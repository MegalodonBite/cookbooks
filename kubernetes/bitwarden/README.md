# Introduction

Despite the name Bitwarden, actually the compatible Vaultwarden project is used here.
See [here](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) for more information on Vaultwarden.
Also have a look into the Vaultwarden wiki [here](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

# Disclaimer

A big part of this deployment was copied from Igor Cicimovs repository [here](https://github.com/icicimov/kubernetes-bitwarden_rs).
Since there was no update on the manifests for a long time, I need to change some API
reference and old configurations that are deprecated by Vaultwarden.
